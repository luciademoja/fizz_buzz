# Fizz Buzz in Ruby

Tiny Ruby program consisting of a bunch of small functions to calculate if a number is divisible by 5, 10 or 15 returning "fizz", "buzz" or "fizzbuzz".
Includes a spec file and rspec in the gemfile to test all possible scenarios.

### How to use it in IRB
 * cd into `fizz_buzz/lib`
 * open the interactive ruby shell typing `irb` in your terminal
 * load the main file typing `load "fizz_buzz.rb"`
 * ask for the number you want to be evaluated inside of the function -> fizz_buzz(your_number)
 
 For `fizz_buzz(5)` irb should return "buzz" and so on.
